Primary data source is road locations as determined by GPS (Global Positioning System), DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) traverse.

In QPWS Access this field is the 'subcategory' field, which is the primary classification field based on QPWS Strategic Asset Management System (SAMS), listed below<br/>Code Description<br/>18 Access Structures for Roads such as vehicle barriers<br/>19 Drainage and Water Control infrastructure<br/>21 Roads<br/>22 Roadway Additional Assets including causeways or floodway<br/>24 Track Structures including boardwalks, pedestrian bridges etc<br/>25 Tracks and Trails including walking tracks, horse trails and mountain bike<br/><br/>Fields specific to subtypes<br/>Asset Type (assettype) - contains road classification listed in "Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service Road Classification System", itself derived in part from the Austroads classification system (1989). Other classifications in this field define the primary purpose and maintenance characteristics for that type of asset.<br/>Asset Group (assetgroup) - contains heights for vehicle bridges, formation for roads, and classification for walking tracks.<br/>Material/Surface (material) - contains a description of the surface type particularly for roads, but also for walking tracks.<br/>Fireline Classification (fireline) -  contains fields defined in the QPWS Procedural Guide for Fireline Classification, Marking and Identification. In the geodatabase version of QPWS Access, only fireline class 4 and fireline class 4 Unconstructed are available when used on conjunction with tracks as these are the only appropriate options.<br/>The following subheadings describe the QPWS Access subtypes and appropriate related records in subsequent fields. This is followed in the next section by a description of fields which are common to all subtypes.<br/><br/>Access Structures Subtype <br/>Subcategory (subcat) <br/>Code Description<br/>18 Access Structures for Roads such as vehicle barriers<br/><br/>Asset Type (assettype)<br/>Code Description<br/>209 Vehicle Barriers, Bollards<br/>NULL NULL values are tracks or roads that are not managed by QPWS and do not appear in SAMS.<br/> <br/>Asset Group (assetgroup) <br/>Code Description<br/>20901 Bollards<br/>20902 Vehicle Barrier<br/>20903 Wheelstop<br/><br/>Material/Surface (material) <br/>Code Description<br/>7 logs<br/>17 stone<br/>20 wood<br/><br/>Fireline Classification (fireline) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 Fireline Class 1<br/>2 Fireline Class 2<br/>3 Fireline Class 3<br/>4 Fireline Class 4<br/>5 Fireline Class 3 Unconstructed<br/>6 Fireline Class 4 Unconstructed<br/>7 Not used for fire<br/><br/><br/>Drainage and Water Control infrastructure Subtype<br/>Subcategory (subcat)  <br/>Code Description<br/>19 Drainage and Water Control infrastructure<br/><br/>Asset Type (assettype)<br/>Code Description<br/>169 Drainage & Water control infrastructure<br/>NULL  NULL values are tracks or roads that are not managed by QPWS and do not appear in SAMS.<br/><br/>Material/Surface (material) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 sealed<br/>2 unsealed<br/>3 natural<br/><br/>Fireline Classification (fireline) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 Fireline Class 1<br/>2 Fireline Class 2<br/>3 Fireline Class 3<br/>4 Fireline Class 4<br/>5 Fireline Class 3 Unconstructed<br/>6 Fireline Class 4 Unconstructed<br/>7 Not used for fire<br/><br/><br/>Roads Subtype<br/>Subcategory (subcat)  <br/>Code Description<br/>21 Roads<br/><br/>Asset Type (assettype) <br/>Code Description<br/>50 4C Local access roads for neighbouring landholders.<br/>56 5C Minor level of access, formed or unformed, unsealed or natural surface.<br/>60 5A Primary access to QPWS Estate, generally formed, sealed or unsealed.<br/>65 3A Rural Arterial roads with high transport use, which would normally be classified as 5A.<br/>69 5B Secondary Access to QPWS estate, moderate traffic, formed or unformed, unsealed.<br/>NULL  NULL values are tracks or roads that are not managed by QPWS and do not appear in SAMS.<br/><br/>Asset Group (assetgroup) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 formed roads or tracks<br/>2 unformed roads or tracks<br/><br/>Material/Surface (material) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 sealed<br/>2 unsealed<br/>3 natural<br/><br/>Fireline Classification (fireline) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 Fireline Class 1<br/>2 Fireline Class 2<br/>3 Fireline Class 3<br/>4 Fireline Class 4<br/>5 Fireline Class 3 Unconstructed<br/>6 Fireline Class 4 Unconstructed<br/>7 Not used for fire<br/><br/>Roadway Additional Assets Subtype<br/>Subcategory (subcat) <br/>Code Description<br/>22 Roadway Additional Assets including causeways or floodway<br/><br/>Asset Type (assettype) <br/>Code Description<br/>179 Vehicle Bridge<br/>180 Causeway/Floodway<br/>NULL  NULL values are tracks or roads that are not managed by QPWS and do not appear in SAMS.<br/><br/>Asset Group (assetgroup) <br/>Code Description<br/>17901 vehicle bridges above 6m<br/>17902 vehicle bridges below 6m<br/><br/>Material/Surface (material) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 sealed<br/>2 unsealed<br/>3 natural<br/><br/>Fireline Classification (fireline) <br/>Code Description<br/>1 Fireline Class 1<br/>2 Fireline Class 2<br/>3 Fireline Class 3<br/>4 Fireline Class 4<br/>5 Fireline Class 3 Unconstructed<br/>6 Fireline Class 4 Unconstructed<br/>7 Not used for fire<br/><br/>Track Structures Subtype<br/>Subcategory (subcat) <br/>Code Description<br/>24 Track Structures including boardwalks, pedestrian bridges etc<br/><br/>Asset Type (assettype) <br/>Code Description<br/>81 Pedestrian Bridges<br/>89 Stairs/ Steps / Ladders - including hand rails/balustrade<br/>NULL  NULL values are tracks or roads that are not managed by QPWS and do not appear in SAMS.<br/><br/>Asset Group (assetgroup) <br/>Code Description<br/>29 Track Class 1 to AS 2156.1.
